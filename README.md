# ðŸ§  Deep Learning-Based UÂ²-Net ID Card Background Remover

This project uses the UÂ²-Net deep learning model to extract ID cards from images by removing backgrounds. The system includes training, evaluation, and a web-based frontend for live inference.

## Features
- Train on custom-labeled ID card images
- Evaluate using metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, IoU)
- Run via Flask API and use a web interface to upload or capture ID cards

## Technologies
- Python, PyTorch, Flask, OpenCV
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Dataset
